# odin-recipes
Repo for the Recipes project from The Odin Project

This is the first project inside The Odin Project. I should be able to:
1. create a new repository on GitHub;
2. create a Recipes website using only HTML, with no concern about styling at this point;
3. commit it to GitHub using only terminal commands.
